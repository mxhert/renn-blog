# About

<section>
  <h2>🛠️ About renn.design</h2>
  <p><strong>renn.design</strong> was founded on a simple goal: to make it easier for builders and designers to create better automotive parts, starting with the legendary <strong>BMW E30</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Born from a passion for clean design and precise fitment, renn.design began as a side project to support my own E30 builds. I needed accurate geometry to model parts, prototype cleanly, and avoid guesswork. After investing in professional-grade 3D scanning equipment and dialing in the process, I realized these same tools could help other builders bring their ideas to life faster and with fewer headaches.</p>
  
  <p>Today, I offer a growing library of high-resolution 3D scans built specifically for automotive designers, engineers, and fabricators. Whether you're building in CAD, testing fitment, or mocking up prototypes, these scans give you a clean digital reference to work from without needing to tear your car apart.</p>

  <h3>👋 About Me</h3>
  <p>I'm <strong>Max</strong>, a product designer by trade and E30 nerd at heart. I've spent years developing aftermarket parts and working with manufacturers across the motorsports industry. renn.design is my way of giving back to the community and building the tools I wish I'd had when I started designing parts from scratch.</p>
